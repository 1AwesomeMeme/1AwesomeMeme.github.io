                 </center>
                 <p>In case you haven't noticed or heard about anything, everyone in The Meme Club was obliterated by Mrs. Parnham, 
                     as she is beginning to look for the student made Google Classrooms. This will not stop us. We will rebuild.
                     We need everyone's support as we go through this tough period, please, if you need to, rejoin The Meme Club, also
                     be sure to invite your friends. Our class code is: v629a9t</p>
